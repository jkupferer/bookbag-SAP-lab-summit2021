== Intro

This workshop can be used to demonstrate the integration capabilities for Red Hat Integration portfolio with SAP's Digital Core.

== High-level architecture and components

The high-level architecture consists of 3 different RHEL 8.x servers:

* *bastion:* this is meant to be used as the jump host for SSH access to the environment and where to run SAP GUI from if required.
* *hana:* this is meant to be used as the RHEL server where to deploy SAP HANA.
* *s4hana:* this is meant to be used as the RHEL server where to deploy SAP S/4HANA.

And an OpenShift 4.x cluster with the following components deployed:

* *OpenShift Container Storage:* used for multi-purpose container storage backend.
* *Fuse Online:* used to demonstrate out of the box easy to implement integration capabilities with SAP S/4HANA and multi-purpose integrations.
* *3scale:* used to demonstrate API management capabilities for both SAP API Business Hub APIs and custom APIs deployed as microservices in OpenShift.
* *Backend Microservice:* used to demonstrate the integration with SAP S/4HANA using Red Hat Fuse.
* *Frontend Microservice:* used to present the data coming from SAP S/4HANA and SAP HANA to the user.

== Lab Access
This environment is provisioned using the Red Hat internal demo system. We at Red Hat embrace the use of IaC (Infrastructure as Code) for any lab/demo set up, that's why we have open-sourced the Framework (based in Ansible) we use for this. If you want to get more information on this topic, check the link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd[AgnosticD] repository we use to deploy these labs and demos.

You can access your lab environment as {user} with password "{ssh_password}" with the following command:

[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="{markup-in-source}"]
